# NEA

I started work on this over the easter holidays, and got a basic prototype that I liked up and running, that was esialy exapndable.
After my mock exams were over  I resumed working on my NEA picking up a few piceses that I had mised, mainly the map stuff. in between working on it, I have been doing alot of reading on OpenGL and socket module in pyhton, and it hurts my brain.
